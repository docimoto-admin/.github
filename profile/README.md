# Docimoto

Docimoto builds open-source document intelligence systems that bridge machine learning research and production-grade engineering, with a focus on structured information extraction from Excel, PDF, Word, and image documents—particularly Excel.

## Open-source projects

- **TableSense2** — Computer vision models and evaluation tooling for spreadsheet table detection.
- **TableSense Simple Annotation UI** — Lightweight tools for creating and validating table detection ground truth in Excel files.

More projects will be released incrementally as part of the Docimoto open-source ecosystem.
